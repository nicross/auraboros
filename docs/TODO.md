# TODOs

## Need to have
- Enemy sounds
  - Enemy movement
  - Enemy hit
  - Enemy death
- SFX
  - Game start (big bang)
  - Game over (reverse of big bang)

## Nice to have
- Rework wormholes so they spawn randomly
  - Start with 1 random wormhole (at random angle halfway between horizon)
  - Every 60 seconds spawn a wormhole until 4 are active
  - Wormholes take 15 seconds to become active
- Matter prop that spawns on kill and flies toward origin (sound changes based on score)
- Horizon directional cue
- Origin prop
- Manual
